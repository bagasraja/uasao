4.  **Save/Commit the `README.md`:** Once you commit the changes to the `README.md` file, the image will be rendered directly on the main page of your repository!

This approach lets you easily update the graphic anytime you change the simulation parameters and run the script again. Let me know if you want to explore any more advanced ways to visualize the data, like generating an interactive chart!
